# Active Context - Azure Infrastructure Creator

## Current Phase

**Phase**: Foundation & Initial Setup
**Status**: In Progress

## What We're Working On

Currently establishing:
- Project structure and boilerplate
- Base TUI framework
- Azure authentication foundation
- Instructions and best practices guides
- Development templates and workflows

## Recent Work

✅ Created TypeScript/Node.js project structure
✅ Initialized GitHub repository
✅ Set up base TUI with inquirer/chalk/ora
✅ Created package.json with Azure SDK dependencies
✅ Established project documentation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create Claude memory bank and instructions
2. Implement Azure authentication module
3. Build VM provisioning feature
4. Add storage account provisioning
5. Implement network resource provisioning

## Current Challenges/Blockers

None at this moment - proceeding smoothly.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js (familiar, good Azure SDK support)
- **TUI**: Inquirer + Chalk + Ora (well-maintained, feature-rich)
- **Architecture**: Modular services pattern for Azure resources
- **Auth**: @azure/identity (supports multiple auth flows)

## Team Notes

Working with Claude Code (Haiku model) for rapid development assistance.
Focus on security, best practices, and user experience from the start.
