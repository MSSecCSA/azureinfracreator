# Active Context - Azure Infrastructure Creator

## Current Phase

**Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Infrastructure & Authentication
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

## What We're Working On

Establishing secure foundation for all infrastructure provisioning:
- Azure authentication with DefaultAzureCredential
- Configuration management (subscription, resource group, region)
- Azure SDK client wrapper with error handling
- Structured audit logging
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)

## Recent Work

✅ Created comprehensive security architecture guide (2,143 lines, 50+ Microsoft Learn citations)
✅ Integrated security guide into project
✅ Created PHASE2-PLANNING.md with full security design
✅ Created PHASE2-TASKS.md with 13-17 hours of detailed tasks
✅ All planning aligned with security-architecture-guide.md

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement AuthService** (Task 2.1.1-2.1.4) - 6-8 hours
   - DefaultAzureCredential setup
   - Credential caching
   - Error handling
   - Unit tests >90%

2. **Implement ConfigService** (Task 2.2.1-2.2.4) - 4-5 hours
   - Config schema design
   - File I/O with validation
   - CLI commands (init, set, get)
   - Unit tests >85%

3. **Implement AzureClient** (Task 2.3.1-2.3.3) - 3-4 hours
   - Azure SDK client wrapper
   - Basic ARM operations
   - Logging and instrumentation
   - Integration tests >85%

4. **Integration & Documentation** (Task 2.4.1-2.4.4) - 2-3 hours
   - Wire up to main CLI
   - Update README
   - Add code citations
   - Final validation

## Current Challenges/Blockers

None at this moment - proceeding smoothly.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js (familiar, good Azure SDK support)
- **TUI**: Inquirer + Chalk + Ora (well-maintained, feature-rich)
- **Architecture**: Modular services pattern for Azure resources
- **Auth**: @azure/identity (supports multiple auth flows)

## Team Notes

Working with Claude Code (Haiku model) for rapid development assistance.
Focus on security, best practices, and user experience from the start.
